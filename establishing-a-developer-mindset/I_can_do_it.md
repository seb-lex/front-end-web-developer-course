Dear Sebastian:

Sometimes seemingly small problems are the biggest stumbling blocks. This is the nature of the work. If you get stuck, then:

1. Research.
2. Make a plan.
3. Execute the plan.
4. Examine the results.

If the problem is solved, move on; if not, ~~start pulling your hair out~~ return to step 1.

You got into this because you love solving problems and learning new things, so enjoy the process. And remember:

Full speed ahead,
